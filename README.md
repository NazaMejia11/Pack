# PACKAI

A modern React and Tailwind CSS website demonstrating a landing page and a packaging brief section.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The landing page welcomes the user and a "Start" button scrolls to a horizontally-scrollable brief section describing the information required to design packaging.
